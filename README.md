✨ About Me

Hi — I’m SaTan Drops. I focus on reversing binaries, securing and building PHP backends, fuzzing and handling APIs, and hunting real-world vulnerabilities.

🔎 Reverse Engineering: binary analysis, decompilation & patch reasoning

🐘 PHP & Backend: REST APIs, JWT / OAuth flows, secure coding

🛡️ Pentesting & Bug Bounty: web app auditing, exploit validation, report writing

⚙️ Tools & Automation: Ghidra, IDA, radare2, Burp Suite, Postman, Wireshark, Docker


🚀 Skills

Reverse Engineering: static & dynamic analysis, decompilers, binary diffing

Web / Backend: PHP, MySQL, REST, GraphQL basics, auth flows

Security Testing: Burp Suite, SQLmap, nmap, Nikto, automated scanning

Scripting & Tools: Python, Bash, small Go utilities, automation for recon

CI / DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Codemagic / Bitrise (configs)


💼 Featured Projects

For each repo, add a short description and a link. If a repo is private or contains sensitive materials, consider publishing a sanitized sample or demo.

awesome-reversing — A curated collection of reversing scripts & snippets (Ghidra, IDA, radare2). 🔧

php-sec-audit — Lightweight scanner to detect insecure PHP configurations and common pitfalls. 🧰

api-fuzz-suite — Simple API fuzzing framework with JWT/session support and automated report output. 🧪


📚 Writeups & Disclosures

I publish writeups and responsible disclosures when possible. Keep a writeups/ folder with step-by-step POC notes and sanitized artifacts (no sensitive data).


📌 GitHub Tricks & Extras

Pinned repos: Pin 4–6 repositories that showcase tools, writeups, and libraries.

Actions: Add a GitHub Action to update README stats or deploy releases automatically. ⚙️

Releases: Publish tagged releases with binaries or builds for CLI tools. 📦

Security policy: Add SECURITY.md describing how to responsibly disclose bugs. 🛡️

PGP key: Publish a PGP key for secure reports (optional). 🔐
